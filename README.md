# Personal Fitness Tracker 🏋️

A **Streamlit-based fitness tracker** that predicts **calories burned** based on exercise parameters using **Linear Regression**. It provides insightful analytics, interactive UI, and personalized recommendations.

## Features ✨
✅ Predicts **calories burned** based on user input (age, BMI, duration, etc.)  
✅ Uses **Linear Regression** for prediction  
✅ **Streamlit UI** with interactive sliders and real-time analytics  
✅ **Visualizations**: Scatter plots showing exercise trends  
✅ **BMI Classification & Personalized Recommendations**  

## Installation 🛠️
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fitness-tracker.git
cd fitness-tracker
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Application
```
streamlit run app.py
```

## How It Works ⚙️
1️⃣ **User enters fitness data** (age, BMI, duration, heart rate, etc.)  
2️⃣ **Linear Regression model** predicts **calories burned**  
3️⃣ **Performance Metrics** (Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error) displayed  
4️⃣ **Scatter Plot** shows exercise duration vs. calories burned  
5️⃣ **BMI classification & fitness recommendations** based on prediction  

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Python** (Core Development)
- **Streamlit** (Web UI)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Processing)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualizations)

## Future Enhancements 🚀
🔹 Add **Neural Network model** for better accuracy  
🔹 Implement **real-time fitness tracking with wearables**  
🔹 Improve UI with more interactive elements
